															   modified the find of ttPcValueGrp to use rowMod, updated the logic to include part creation.  Needed to set rowMOd to Deleted because
															   the PcValueGrp Group SEq column changes from 0 to the appropriate value and without removing the original row the UI had 2 rows.
															   Cleaned up some issues in method UpdateQuote.  Exceptions were being thrown when configuring a QuoteAsm because the logic was still
															   following the old way of only including the GroupSeq on the QuoteDtl.
															   Modified method SuggestSmartString.  In a multi-level configuration where child configurations have part creation enabled, the
															   suggested smart string when partnumber+sequential number is used, for the child suggested the parent part.  Added logic to use the struct tag to find
															   the correct ttPcStructRow instaed of the savedGroupSeq and SaveHeadNum.  Since SavedGroupSeq and SaveHeadNum are no longer used in this method I updated
															   the method signature.

01/28/14 - nzirbes scr 134214 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> Modified method CreatePart to interrogate ResponseAutoCreatepart.  When saving input values, method CreatePart needs to update the Saved Input values PCValueGrp with
                                                           the new partRev SysRowID. 
														   UpdateQuote logic nees to use the savedGroupSeq for finding the QuoteDtl and not the SaveInputs GroupSeq otherwise the user cannot review pcvalues
														   for an already Quote Line (QuoteDtl).
														   UpdateJob cannot assume that the target being configured is the Jobhead and throw an exception when it is not found using incorrect values.  
								ConfigurationRunTime.Queries.cs -> corrected a poorly formed query, findFirstPartRevAltQuery so it does not throw a null exception.  This was found by configuring a purchased material
								                                   on a job.  Added a few additional queries.
								Strings.resx -> new strings

06/18/2015 - nzirbes    - SCR 164081 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> removed ConfiguratorUtil.nStructID, updated method signature to GetConfigurationSequence, implemented testRulesMessage since
                                       the configuratorUtil static property no longer exists
06/22/2015 - chkollasch - SCR 161798 - Added the erp context to the ResolveGroupSeq method in ConfigUtls and add a check for group seq when checking for use base.
06/29/2015 - chkollasch - scr 162359 - We want to preserver BasePartNum and BasePartRev even if we are not creating an configured part.
07/06/2015 - vdavila    - SCR 163753 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> Move PartRev.BasePartNum to PcE10-PC
07/07/2015 - vdavila    - SCR 163753 - Clean up code
07/08/2015 - nzirbes    - scr 165690 - Configurationruntime.cs -> moved methods related to CreatePart to new assembly Erp.Internal.PC.CreatePart.
07/10/2015 - psiller    - scr 166722 - Configurationruntime.cs -> Added validation to avoid null reference exception in configurations on the fly.
10/07/2015 - psiller    - scr 171453 - Enhanced EpiPcPictureBox Control.
10/09/2015 - mcontreras - scr 172659 - Set DecimalValue at PcUserDefinedMethodParam table to 8 decimals for DecimalValue field, to avoid rounding errors with ud methods.
10/19/2015 - nzirbes    - scr 173388 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> modified method PreStartConfiguration.  Added logic for 'set part num only' scenarios to set the correct value of 
                                       curPartNum and curRevisionNum so reconfigure scenarios work.  Created 2 methods to handle the setting of curPartNum and curRevisionNum.  Intentionally did not implement
									   calls to that method in other places at this time due to the 400 code cut date.  
10/22/2015 - n zirbes   - scr 173589 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> use the related to row when reconfiguring a part that was created as a non-configurable part to determine the ConfigID
                                       Strings.resx -> added a new string - UnableToResolveConfigID
10/26/2015 - nzirbes    - scr 173589 - Strings.resx - removed UnableToResolveConfigID since it is not needed
                                       ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> removed the exception being thrown in PreStartConfiguration if we have a ConfigID that is null or empty.  Configurations on the fly will not have
									   a configID and that is correct.  The processing needs to continue.  We will identify the configID in GetConfigurationSequence so an exception should not be thrown at this time.
10/26/2015 - nzirbes    - scr 173589 -  ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> resolved null exception in PreStartConfiguration when processing a configuration on the fly and there is no PcStatus.
10/29/2015 - mcontreras - scr 170203 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> Relocate afterProcessDocRules to OrderDtl write trigger, to update the BookDtl values after OrderDtl is modified by the Configurator

12/08/2015 - vdavila    - SCR 173579 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified PreStartConfiguration to took correct PartNum and RevisionNum from foreign row
01/05/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 177503 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added logic to compare the PCConv905 conversion run date to the product owner specified target entity date
                                                              to determine if the call to the converPcInValue logic should be executed.  This prevents unnecessary calls to that assembly for those target
															  entities that were created after the database was converted.
															  Cleaned up warnings.  Created scr 178432 for a query that has a warning so further research can be done.
									   ConfigurationRuntime.Queries.cs -> new query findCnvProgsQuery, modified ExistsPcInputs to .Any from .Count per warnings,new query findPOOrderDateQuery,
                                                                          modified selectQuoteMtlQuery to use assemblySeq_ex in the where clause instead of row.AssemblySeq = quoteLine_ex 
										AssemblyInfo.cs -> checked in for Unit Test purposes

									   Create Configurator from Part Creation was removed in clean up.
03/16/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 182442 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added new method GetAllPictureBoxImages that is responsible for retrieving all of the images for a page in a configurator in one
                                       trip to the server.  
									   Resolved code analysis warnings. 
									   Modified the new method so it can be unit tested.
03/17/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 182442 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> changed the Dictionary type to List<KeyValuePair<string, byte[]>> because EWA cannot support type Dictionary because the xmlSerializer
                                       does not have an equality comparer.
04/01/2016 - psiller    - scr 153271 - Changed datalookup methods to have defined parameters instead of a string array.
04/04/2016 - psiller    - scr 153271 - Peer review changes. Fixed typo and added description to method's parameters.
04/07/2016 - psiller    - SCR 163336 - Removed unused references.

06/02/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 182025 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added method PopulatePcConfigSmartString.  This method builds the temp table that contains the configuration level smart string options that are needed in the
                                       SystemFunctionsLib to support GetSmartString();
									   NOTE: ZData changes were made in the SD for this service.  See scr resolution notes for the details.  New table PcConfigSmartString.
06/21/2016 - vdavila    - SCR 185725 - Added method leaveDocumentRules to validate if will run document rules

08/16/2016 - JShay		- SCR 189988 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Added validation to PreStartConfiguration method to don't try to identify the PcStatus with the BasePartNum if IsTestPlan is true to avoid object reference error.
08/23/2016 - JShay		- SCR 190578 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified leaveDocumentRules and ProcessNICDocumentRules to create the PCValue records for NIC subassemblies and allow run the method rules, according with SCR 185725 document rules are not executed for subassemblies.
10/07/2016 - MContreras - SCR 192134 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Split main transaction into several smaller blocks.
10/11/2016 MContreras SCR 192134 - PartCreation.cs - Peer Review corrections to include Test Rules in transaction scope
10/26/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 193312 - ConfigurationRuntime.Queries.cs -> new query to retrieve the Byte[] for the QBuild drawings
                                       ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> new public method to retrieve all images and drawings in one trip to the server
11/01/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 193312 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> restructured method GetAllImagesAndDrawings to return a tableset instead of 2 out KVP parameters due to
                                       a limitation in EWA.
11/30/2016 - nzirbes    - SCR 193318 - ConfiguraitonRuntime.cs -. updated the drawing and images logic to support run time changes
12/14/2016 - nzirbes    - scr 193317 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added logic to redisplay the configured drawing
01/06/2017 - nzirbes    - scr 193317 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added HeadNum to method GetAllImagesAndDrawings.
01/11/2017 - nzirbes    - scr 193317 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> Modified GetAllImagesAndDrawings method and removed the Drawing logic since the PcConfiguredDrawings table handles both the configure and reconfigure (tracker too) scenarios.
                                       Renamed the method to GetAllImages so it reflects what it actually does.  This method was added as part of the QBuild project so this is not a SIC change.
									   ConfigurationRuntTime.Queries.cs -> removed unused query per CA warning.
01/31/2017 - nzirbes    - EN 10111   - Generated in the SD to pick up the new external column on PcConfiguredDrawings -> QBuildObjExist
03/22/2017 - mvillarreal - SCR 200045 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified EDIValidateSmartString to trim in input value when the data type is string.
04/08/2017 - JShay		 - SCR 199754 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Send paremeter to the ChangePartNum method in order to refresh the part and quantities.
06/13/2017 - JShay		 - SCR 203733 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified exportPartCreationInfo to complete the transaction scope before return if part is not found.
06/22/17   - BillE       - SCR 203076 - EN-2844 - Added new column QtyPerCycle and regenerated service.
08/31/2017 - JShay		 - SCR 200046 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified EDIValidateSmartString method to validate segments of the incoming smart string that correspond to combo boxes with the List Items property when they do not have dynamic list. In addition, segments that correspond to character inputs are validated with the valid list property.
										ConfigurationRuntime.Queries.cs: Modified query to verify if the combo box has dynamic lists.
										Strings.resx: Added new string to be displayed when segments of the incoming smart string that correspond to combo boxes are not valid.
11/15/17 - mvillarreal - SCR 207610   - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified SavePcValueConfiguration method to not set an argument in ChangePartNum
11/30/17 - jstevermer  - SCR 209602   - (EN-4446) - New quote columns for dealer portal and regen
12/11/2017 nzirbes erp-127 scr 210309 - Added a validation in the PreStartConfiguration to prevent the deploying of PCEMF configurators.
12/11/2017 jstevermer - SCR 209602 (ERP-89, ERP-98) - New quote columns for dealer portal and regen
12/19/2017 nzirbes erp-125 scr 310309 - MaintTransaction.cs -> PreStartConfiguration: In an attempt to make things as easy as possible for EMF added logic
                                        to handle a null or empty SourceTable and update the configparams part/revision with the details from
										the relatedToRow and use those values to find the partRev unless TestID is not Guid.Empty then we use PcStatus.
										  Note: if emf needs an alternate rev then the configParams must be updated. 
									    Added a validation and exception if sourceRow is null.  We must always have a source row in	order to configure.
										When the ttPcValueGrp is created during the prestart logic set RowMod so EMF does not have to
12/20/2017 jstevermer  SCR 209602 - ERP-90: Implemented new DealerNetworkManagement license
01/05/2018 nzirbes     scr 210309 ERP-166: EMF support.  Added a column ConfigType to ConfigurationParams.   Restructured the PreStartConfiguration method and moved the logic needed by Win client and
                                           EMF to new method ValidateAndBuildConfigurationData. In the new validateAndBuild method added logic to update the params ConfigType and to return
										   when win client calls prestart for a PCEMF configurator.  The logic to launch an EMF configurator has been centralized in the client 
										   config run time engine.  In order to do this, an initial call to PreStart is needed in order to identify the config type.  I did this to avoid an 
										   additional round trip to the server just to launch a configurator and to avoid adding ConfigType to every possible target entity.  
										   Modified GetPCTransportTableset to call the new ValidateAndBuildConfigurationData method.  Corrected typo on config type. 
01/08/2018 - mvillarreal SCR 209746	  -  ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified SavePcValueConfiguration method to defines the target entity when creates a new part
01/09/2018 - nzirbes scr 210309 erp-166 - changes per peer review suggestions
01/19/2018 - nizrbes scr 207810 - Modified method buildSummaryValues to use the correct property for company in the query

01/26/2018 - nizrbes - scr 210309 ERP 636 - corrected the logic in prestart that addresses EMF.
01/29/2018 - nzirbes - scr 210309 ERP854 - added check for null pcstatus in pre start logic; update EMFConfiguratorURL based upon company setting.
01/31/2018 - nzirbes - scr 210309 ERP999 - Configurations on the fly do not have a PcStatus therefore the validation to make sure one was found only applies when
                                           configID is not null or empty.
02/22/2018 - JShay	 - SCR 209746 - Added condition to avoid execute ChangePartNum after PartCreation if the new part does not exists in the database because if it does not exists the current details should be retained.
03/07/2018 - nzirbes - ERP-1744 - MaintTransaction.cs : modified GetPcValueTransportTableset to execute the correct DealerNetwork check.
03/09/2018 - nzirbes - ERP-1823 - MaintTransaction.cs : modified method VallidateAndBuildConfigurationData to check for calledFromWinClient to be true.
                                         This field is used to determine if EMF called the configurator or WinClient.  It helps prevent unnecessary
										 processing because once we find out we are starting a PCEMF configurator we need to return back to win
										 client and launch the iFrame that will open the EMF configurator.
03/21/2018 - JShay - ERPS-74396 - Changes to allow execute new document rule actions that are related with part creation and only affect the Part table in top and lower levels:
									Modified SavePcValueConfiguration method to execute ProcessDocumentRules for lower levels when part creation was executed and the part exists in the database.
									Modified leaveDocumentRules to avoid return from ProcessDocumentRules when the configuration is linked to a subassembly.
									Modified ProcessDocumentRules: get the PcStruct based on the TgtStructTag of the parameters, get the foreignRow if it is not null to correctly execute resolve for configurations that are linked to a subassembly and fill the OnlypartCreationRules argument to execute only the new document rules actions for lower levels.
03/30/2018 -  nzirbes ERP-2299 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> corrected the dealer net license check in method SavePCTransportConfiguration

05/09/2018 - mcontreras ERP-2506 Peer review correction. Check for ConfigType param and return when EMF is found.
05/14/2018 - nzirbes ERP-3108 - ConfigurationRunTime.cs -> Modified PreStartConfiguration to first  the ttPcConfigurationParams row and then call ValidateAndBuild to eliminate an exception
                                                           when processing a configuration-on-the-fly.  When a config-on-the-fly is processed the RowMod for the params row is set to string.empty
														   therefore finding it in prestart AFTER the call to validateAndBuild fails.
05/16/2018 - nzirbes ERP-2668 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs -> added logic to check for a layered image input and throw an exception if one exists and the user is trying to deploy to EWA
05/22/2018 - nzirbes ERP-3249 - ConfigurationRuntime.Queries.cs -> corrected indexOf clause in query ExistsPcInputLayeredImage; resolved CA warning and several informational message warnings

10/31/2018 - nzirbes - ERP-7570 - Added logic to support TestRules for EWC.  Added serialize logic to store the results dataset in the filestore since the EWC side cannot send that dataset back to the client.
11/27/2018 - nzirbes - ERP-8697 - Added logic to support Smart String for EWC.  Due to how EWA and REST pass data EWC cannot support the PCKeyValuePair type.  Implemented a new endpoint for EWC to call
                                  that uses the generic type they can support.  Refactored the shared logic between the original method and this new one so we do not have duplicate code.  
								  Intentionally did not change the type on the original method since that would be a SIC change and would break EWA.  
								  In a future release we should consider obsoleting the original method and using the new one in all places.
								  I am intentionally not adding this new endpoint to the adapter since it is not intended to be called from Win client.

                                  during the Enterprise Configuration logic where the zip file was not created but all rows were transferred.  The PO decided at this time to not provide a process to
								  mass deploy the enterprise configurator in the sales companies.

																  Modified PcInputsPublishToDocParams method to change data type from PcStatus by PcStatusEntResult  
										 ConfigurationRuntime.Queries.cs: Added query FindFirstPcStatusResult and FindFirstPcStatusEntResult
11/11/2019 - JShay		- ERPS-124047 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: I applied the next changes to improve the performance for check syntax and test inputs/rules when the configurator is linked to many revisions:
																	* Modified the next methods to invoke the DeleteConfigurationAndMethodRuleEngine method when the ConfigStatus is Test and SourceTableName of PcStruct is PartRev, that method deletes the Server assembly and the assembly generated for the Method Rule Engine: StartPcValueConfiguration, StartConfiguration, SavePcValueConfiguration, SaveConfiguration, SaveMultiConfiguration, and DeleteAssembliesInTestMode.
																		- When the SourceTableName of the PcStruct is PartRev and the ConfigStatus is Test, it means that Test Rules invoked those methods and generated the Server assembly and the one for Method Rule Engine, that's why we need to delete both. Test Inputs doesn't not generate the assembly for Method Rule Engine.
																	* I modified the DeleteAssembliesInTestMode method also to do the foreach through the PcStruct rows that have a RowMod in order to avoid trying to delete the assemblies for a PcStruct twice.
																	* Modified TestNICRules method to invoke DeleteConfigurationAndMethodRuleEngine instead of DeleteConfiguration because NIC can only do Test Rules which generates the assemblies for Server and Method Rule Engine, so both needs to be deleted at the end.
01/13/2020 - JesusC     - ERPS-130375 - ConfigurationRuntime.cs: Modified method SavePcValueConfiguration to receive the boolean value from CreatePart and with that value use the condition to refresh or not the part values.
